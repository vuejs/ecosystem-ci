# Vue Ecosystem CI

This repository is used to run integration tests for vue ecosystem projects

## via github workflow

### scheduled

Workflows are scheduled to run automatically every Monday, Wednesday and Friday

### manually

- open [workflow](../../actions/workflows/ecosystem-ci-selected.yml)
- click 'Run workflow' button on top right of the list
- select suite to run in dropdown
- start workflow

## via shell script

- clone this repo
- run `pnpm i`
- run `pnpm test` to run all suites
- or `pnpm test <suitename>` to select a suite
- or `tsx ecosystem-ci.ts`

Note if you are not using `pnpm` through `corepack` locally, you need to prepend every command with `COREPACK_ENABLE_STRICT=0 `.

You can pass `--tag v3.2.0-beta.1`, `--branch somebranch` or `--commit abcd1234` option to select a specific vue version to build.
If you pass `--release 3.2.45`, vue build will be skipped and vue is fetched from the registry instead.

The repositories are checked out into `workspace` subdirectory as shallow clones.

If you want to test the same version of vue multiple times, please run `pnpm clean` first to ensure the workspace is clean.

## how to add a new integration test

- check out the existing [tests](./tests) and add one yourself. Thanks to some utilities it is really easy
- once you are confidente the suite works, add it to the lists of suites in the [workflows](../../actions/)

> the current utilities focus on pnpm based projects. Consider switching to pnpm or contribute utilities for other pms

If your project needs some special setup when running in the Ecosystem CI, you can detect the environment by checking for the `ECOSYSTEM_CI` environment variable. It would be set to `vue` if running in the Vue Ecosystem CI.
